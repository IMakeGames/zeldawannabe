Changes I want to implement:

- Subtraction of event tiks must be done on update method. Update method should be the one that determines counter tiks and everything about it.

- Change in recoil method. Total recoil frames should account for the total amount of time the char is in recoil state.

- No more bullshit. All movement should be dictated by movement method.

- Move method should try and perform move using speed variables for axes
